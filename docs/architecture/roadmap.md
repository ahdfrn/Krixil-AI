# Roadmap

Each phase must be runnable and tested before the next one starts — no phase is scoped until the prior one is done.

- **Phase 0 — Foundation** (done): repo skeleton, FastAPI, Postgres/Redis/MinIO, config, structured logging,
  auth (register/login, JWT), tenant context + isolation, model abstraction + mock provider, streaming chat
  endpoint, Alembic migrations, offline test suite. See `phase0.md`.
- **Phase 1 — Real model providers + memory** (done): a real `CloudModelProvider` (OpenAI-compatible
  HTTP client), short-term conversation memory in Redis, per-tenant rate limiting, usage tracking. See `phase1.md`.
- **Phase 2 — RAG** (done): document upload/parsing/chunking/embedding, pgvector similarity search
  (HNSW), keyword full-text search (GIN), hybrid merge (RRF), citations in chat responses. See `phase2.md`.
- **Phase 3 — Tools & permissions** (done): tool registry/schema/permission/risk-based execution/audit
  trail, human approval workflow for HIGH/CRITICAL tools, 3 real tools (`knowledge.search`,
  `usage.get_summary`, `document.delete`). Business/POS tools (`sales.get_summary`, etc.) deferred until
  there's an actual external system to connect to. See `phase3.md`.
- **Phase 4 — Agents** (done, current): planner/executor/observer loop (`POST /agents/run`,
  `GET /agents/{id}/status`), step/tool-call/time budgets, real `tool_call()` function-calling on both
  providers, human-approval integration with Phase 3. Specialized agents (research, data analyst, coding)
  deferred the same way Phase 3's business tools were — real capabilities to connect first. See `phase4.md`.
- **Phase 5 — Evaluation, observability, hardening**: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana, AI evaluation
  harness with baseline comparison, staging/production environment split, CI/CD pipeline with rollback.

Later, not yet scheduled: fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) pipeline, self-hosted inference via vLLM, Next.js web app,
Kubernetes migration.
